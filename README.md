# PraiseTheMessage
This tool is designed to help the user quickly locate message terms within the Elden Ring message library, which is often arbitrary and obtuse (why is pickle a concept?).

[demo]

# How To Use This Tool
Navigate to the [following link](https://praisethemessage.netlify.app/) and enter your desired term into the provided search bar. The page should highlight and list the corresponding category for the provided term. 

Alternatively, you can use your browsers search feature (ctrl+F) and find it that way. 

# Additional Notes
Please note that although this code is my own, the idea came from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/thsfju/i_created_a_web_app_to_easily_find_a_message_term/) by user "dpahoe" who shared their web app ([tryfinger.com](https://www.tryfinger.com/)) that served the same purpose but is currently down for whatever reason (at least as of Dec. 2023). I found their app so useful that I made [PraiseTheMessage](https://praisethemessage.netlify.app/) in response to its absence.

# Alternatives
If this site ever goes down, you can try the following alternatives:
1. Multiple blog posts like [this one from Steamlists](https://steamlists.com/elden-ring-list-of-messages-words-phrases/) list all of the message terms - simply use your browsers search feature (ctrl+F) to find the word you're looking for, and scroll up for its category.
2. Fextralife's [Elden Ring Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messages) has a similar page because of course they do.
3. [Tryfinger.com](https://www.tryfinger.com/) might be back online! Give it a shot!

I expect there are other similar resources that are not listed here.

Look carefully\
In short, try reserach.
