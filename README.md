# PraiseTheMessage
This tool is designed to help users quickly locate message terms within the Elden Ring message library.

[demo]

# How To Use This Tool
Navigate to the [following link](https://praisethemessage.netlify.app/) and enter your desired term into the provided search bar. The page should highlight and list the corresponding category for the provided term. 

Alternatively, you can use your browsers search feature (ctrl+F) and find it that way. 

# Planned Updates
I intend to include a page and relevant serach bar for each of the major souls-like games (that I am aware of) which have a similar message system (Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne). If you notice any missing games you would like to see included, be sure to [make a feature request!](https://github.com/MediumBob/PraiseTheMessage/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

# Additional Notes
Please note that although this code is my own, the idea came from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/thsfju/i_created_a_web_app_to_easily_find_a_message_term/) by user "dpahoe" who shared their web app ([tryfinger.com](https://www.tryfinger.com/)) that served the same purpose but is currently down for whatever reason. I found their app so useful that I made [PraiseTheMessage](https://praisethemessage.netlify.app/) in response to its absence.
