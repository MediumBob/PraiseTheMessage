# PraiseTheMessage
This tool is designed to help users quickly locate message terms within the message menus of FromSoftware games.

![Demo](https://github.com/MediumBob/PraiseTheMessage/blob/main/assets/images/PTM_Demo.gif)


# How To Use This Tool
1. Navigate to the [following link](https://praisethemessage.netlify.app/).
2. Select your desired  game from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter your desired term into the provided search bar. 

The page should then highlight and list the corresponding categories for the provided term. 

Alternatively, you can use your browsers search feature (ctrl+F) and find it that way. 

# Planned Updates
I intend to include functionality for each of the major souls-like games which have a similar message system (Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, etc). If you notice any missing games you would like to see included, be sure to [make a feature request!](https://github.com/MediumBob/PraiseTheMessage/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

I do not currently own many of these games and am therefore unable to directly verify the accuracy of the terms/template lists that I find online, which complicates the completion of these updates. I will continue to update this tool once I am able to verify that my list of terms is accurate and comprehensive.

# Additional Notes
Please note that although this code is my own, the idea came from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/thsfju/i_created_a_web_app_to_easily_find_a_message_term/) by user "dpahoe" who shared their web app ([tryfinger.com](https://www.tryfinger.com/)) that served a similar purpose for Elden Ring, but is currently down for whatever reason. I found their app so useful that I made [PraiseTheMessage](https://praisethemessage.netlify.app/) in response to its absence.
